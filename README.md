# LOD

This repository contains a list of computer vision datasets for common deep learning tasks.

## Why it exists?

There are a lot of CV datasets available online. But when you want to find a dataset for specific purpose, it is very hard to search. In this repository, datasets are listed for common deep learning tasks under categories like this:

* General (People, Objects, Animals, etc.)
* Objects
* People
* Scene
* Animals
* Medical
* and so on
